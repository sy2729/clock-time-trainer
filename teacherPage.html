      <h2>Learning Objective</h2>
      <p>The objectives of this website is to help young kids <strong> understand </strong> and be able to <strong> read </strong> clock time quickly.</p><br>
      <p>When I was young, I wasn't able to read clock in several seconds. I have to go through the caculation process, converting time through the clock's visual system which might be complicated for kids. So having this website doing some trainings to the kids will help them be familiar with the clock system.</p>

      <h2>How the student page is designed</h2>
      <p>There are mainly four activities on this website. First, students are supposed to guess the clock time from the digitals; Second, they can control the hands of hour, minute and second by typing in numbers; Third, they can switch back and forth between different forms of time; Lastly, they could fasten the time and observe the past of one day in one minute or one hour, which might deepen their understanding of how clock works.</p><br>

      <h2>How to use and apply</h2>
      <p>Teachers should first create a scenarios where students have to figure out the time, otherwise they would be late for a class or meeting. Since clock is the only available tool at hand, they have no choice but try to read the time on their own</p><br>
      <p>Then teachers could present the students with this website, requiring them to click around on this website, changing different settings, and familiarize themseleves with the clock and its operation.</p>
      <p>After having fun with the clock, teachers can ask the students to write down their reflection on how clock works and what they've learned about the clock.</p>
